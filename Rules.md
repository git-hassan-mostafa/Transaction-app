## Steps to Add a new Page.

- Run in the command : npm run gc /Pages/PageName (This will create a folder under Pages folder and create a "PageName.tsx" file under /app folder).

- In the pages list in C:\Users\Pc\Desktop\Transaction-app\Global\Constants\Pages.ts add new page to the list with all its data.

- And now you have a new page.
